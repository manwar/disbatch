# things i don't like about perltidy:
# - blank line before comments
# - weird use of { } for the hashes used by tie in lib/Pinscher/Core/EventBus.pm
# - uncuddled catch
# - lined up = (yet sometimes breaks this)
# - tight hashes (otherwise loose use of @{ ... } and $foo->{ ... })
-b		# backup original to .bak and modify file in-place
-l=400		# 400 chars per line
-i=4		# 4 columns per indentation
-dt=4		# default tab size. (default is 8)
-it=4		# causes perltidy to do n complete iterations
-bar		# opening brace always on right, even for long clauses
-nsfs		# no add space before semicolon in for( ; ; )
-nolq		# no outdent long quoted strings
-boc		# try to break at all old commas (in case the formatting is intentional)
-pt=2		# paren tightness - very tight			(def 1)
-sbt=1		# square tightness - very tight			(def 1)
-bt=2		# curly tightness (no code) - very tight	(def 1)
-bbt=0		# curly tightness (code) - very tight		(def 0)
-ce		# cuddled else
